# Get Familiar with Material UI library

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Documentation

[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/)

## Description

This project is meant to build simple components (one by one) and demonstrate them. Therefore, learning to use them more effectively.

It will mostly reuse the code example available in the Material UI documentation, so nothing new here.
